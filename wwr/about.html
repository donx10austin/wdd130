             <h2>History</h2>
             <p>White Water Rafting Adventure Activities was established in 2023 and is owned and run by an African, Austin Anumudu, with  years of experience both on the water and in the mountains. We are a small business with a core team; we really care about our clients and their experiences with us and our unrivalled feedback reflects this,
                We do not hire any freelance guides and every trip is personally run by me. You are guaranteed the best adventure safe in the hand of the most experienced and personal instructor in Rafting. I use locally manufactured and world famous DMM safety equipment and the warmest 5mm winter thickness wetsuits; comfort, safety and enjoyment are top priority.</p>
