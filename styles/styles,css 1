      <p>Hello! My name is Austin Anumudu, and I am from Lagos, Nigeria. I am a painter, I love football, and I'm a Liverpool FC fan.
        I am currently studying Software Development at BYU-Idaho. I’m super excited to learn more about web development and design.
        I look forward to creating my own website and exploring more about the tech industry. I'm excited to see what the future holds for me.

      <p>Nigeria is a country located in the western part of Africa. With a population of over 250 million people, it is well known for its hospitality.
        Nigerians are recognized for being peaceful, accommodating, hardworking, and God-fearing. Major tribes include the Igbo, Hausa, and Yoruba.
        The country is rich in natural resources and is one of the world's major exporters of crude oil and gold. Many citizens work as farmers, doctors,
        bankers, and engineers. Nigeria has 36 states, including Lagos, which hosts the largest seaport in Africa, while Abuja serves as the capital city.
